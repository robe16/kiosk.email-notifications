# kiosk.grandparent-message-board

A mini project to create a 'kiosk' for a relative to display key information during the day.

I aim for the information and messages to be 'dementia friendly' (research to be undertaken regarding this).

Developed so far:
- Current 'time' (e.g. "Now it's Thursday monrning")
- Current/next carer information (when and name). This is taken from the weekly schedule hosted by [AxisCare](https://1000.axiscare.com)

Yet to investigate and develop:
- Weather (today/tomorrow/this afternoon/etc. ??)
- Messages input into a Google Sheet with expiry date/time
- Messages (and maybe images) emailed to dedicated mailbox from a safelist of senders (e.g. family members)
